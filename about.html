  <h3 id="what-we-do">What we do</h3>
  <p>Our research is centered on understanding the dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution. We develop and apply mathematical, computational, and statistical methods to explore how ecological interactions and evolutionary processes mutually shape each other. Our main research areas include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Eco-Evolutionary Networks</strong>: <br>
      We study networks in which species interactions and evolutionary changes co-occur. By modeling how traits evolve in response to ecological pressures—and how, in turn, evolving traits alter network structure—we uncover feedbacks that drive community organization and biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Dynamics and Evolutionary Game Theory</strong>: <br>
      We extend classical game-theoretical approaches by incorporating ecological context. Our models examine how competition, cooperation, and resource allocation drive the evolution of species traits, leading to adaptive shifts that impact community stability and resilience.</li>
    <li><strong>Coupled Population and Trait Dynamics</strong>: <br>
      Integrating models of population dynamics with trait evolution, we investigate scenarios where ecological conditions and evolutionary adaptations reinforce or counteract one another. This approach helps us understand phenomena such as rapid evolutionary responses to environmental change and the emergence of novel community configurations.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>General Considerations</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Theoretical Focus:</strong><br>
  Our work is primarily theoretical—integrating mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches to address eco‑evolutionary questions. Any experimental or field work is carried out in close collaboration with external laboratories.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Innovative Methods:</strong><br>
  We consistently adopt new and innovative methods and tools. The key quality we value is a strong willingness to learn and master complex techniques.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Programming Culture:</strong><br>
  Programming is central to our research. We primarily use Julia, Python, and C to develop and test our models, ensuring a unified approach that enhances collaboration and efficiency.
</p>

<h4>Opportunities</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Graduate Students:</strong><br>
  We welcome applications from graduate students in Ecology, Evolution, and related fields who have a solid grounding in mathematics and programming—or are eager to develop these skills. If you’re considering applying, please get in touch well in advance so that we have time to discuss our research and your interests.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bachelor’s and Master’s Students:</strong><br>
  Motivated students at the bachelor’s or master’s level who possess basic knowledge in math and programming, or who are willing to learn, are also encouraged to join our team. We offer opportunities for hands-on involvement in ongoing projects.
</p>

<h4>Diversity</h4>
<p>
  Our group values diversity in all its forms—be it background, scientific approach, or culture. We especially welcome applications from historically underrepresented groups in science, as we believe that diverse perspectives drive innovation.
